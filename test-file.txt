Not safe for work (NSFW) is Internet slang or shorthand used to mark links to content, 
videos or website pages the viewer may not wish to be seen looking at in a public, for

mal or controlled environment. The marked content may contain nudity, pornography, polit


ical incorrectness, profanity, slurs, graphic violence or other potentially disturbing subject ma
tter. Environments that may be problematic include workplaces, schools, and family settings.[1][2]
NSFW has particular relevance for people trying to make personal use of the Internet at workplaces or sc
hools which have policies prohibiting access to sexual and graphic subject matter.[3] Conversely, safe for work (SFW)
is used for links that do not contain such material,[4] but where the title might oth
erwise lead people to think that content is NSFW.[5]
