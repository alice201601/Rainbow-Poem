Green hills skirt the northern border,

White waters gird the eastern town;

Here we part with each other,

And you set out like a lonesome wisp of grass,

Floating across the miles, farther and farther away.

Youâ€™ve longed to travel like roaming clouds,

But our friendship, unwilling to wane as the sun is to set,
